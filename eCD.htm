                <h1>What is a electronic high-yield certificate of deposit?</h1>
                <p>A high-yield electronic <a href="intro-cerficate-of-deposit.html">certificate of deposit</a> (eCD) will earn you the highest certificate of deposit interest rates, but traditionally requires a larger investment. At CFS, you can open a high-yield eCD only requires a minimum deposit of $100 online!

                <h1>What are the benefits of a CFS high-yield eCD?</h1>
                <p>
                    At first, if you're interested in investment and already heavily invested in the stock market, a high-yield eCD can prevent you from some of the market's volatility, as well as provide you with a secure investment at a guaranteed return.
                    Then, your deposit at CFS is insured by the FDIC to the maximum amount allowed by law, so your high-yield eCD investment is protected.
                    Finally, open a eCD online can reduce the time for you to wait for branch stuff to serve you and the money CFS saves can be transferred to high interest rates for you.
