                <h1>What Are the Advantages of an Online Checking Account?</h1>
                <p>
                    An online checking account offers a variety of benefits ranging from convenience to security. When
                    you have an online checking account, you can access it anytime, 24/7...

                    CFS offers several different types of checking accounts, all with online banking access.
                    CFS also offers eChecking, an all-electronic online checking account that allows you to earn
                    interest on the funds in your account.
                    You can open an online checking account with a small deposit, and there's no minimum daily balance.
                </p>

                <h1>How do I choose the best online checking account?</h1>
                <p>
                    Assessing your needs is the most important thing to do before choosing any checking account.
                    Determine how many checks you usually write each month, what minimum balance you can comfortably
                    maintain, and what, if any other features, such as interest, online banking and ATM access, are
                    important to you.

                    In most cases, you'll have to deposit your money through the mail with an online checking account.
                    Some banks, like CFS, also allow you to deposit money through an ATM machine or by direct deposit.

                    Since some online banks charge a small fee when you write a paper check, an online checking account
                    may not be the best option if you need to write many checks. These days, however, many bills can be
                    paid online with bill-pay or by debit card, so you may still find an online checking account a
                    reasonable solution.

                <h1>Is a Free Checking Account Right for Me?</h1>
                <p>
                    Although free checking accounts don't typically earn interest, they still offer a variety of
                    convenient benefits, ranging from no minimum balances to unlimited transactions.
            </section>
            <section class="article-preview">
                <h1>Should I open a free checking account?</h1>
                <p>
                    A free checking account from CFS doesn't require you to maintain a specific minimum daily balance.
                    And you can open a free checking account with a small deposit.

                    The people most suited for a free checking account are typically those who don't maintain a large
                    balance in their account or have limited funds available to open a new checking account. That's why
                    free checking accounts are often a good choice when you are opening your first checking account.

                    You may also want to open a free checking account if you write a large number of checks, or have
                    your money invested elsewhere, and earning interest on your account isn't important to you.

                    If you would prefer a more flexible checking account, such as a high-yield checking account, check
                    out CFS's other checking account products. You can also view all CFS's financial services available

                <h1>The best free checking accounts are really free</h1>
                <p>
                    Sometimes a free checking account isn't always free. Make sure you read and understand the fine
                    print before opening your free checking account because sometimes there are hidden costs. On the
                    flip side, a free checking account may also offer some useful perks. Some of the most common
                    questions are:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the minimum (and maximum) usage terms, if any?</li>
                    <li>Are there any monthly fees? If so, how can you avoid them?</li>
                    <li>Will you need to purchase your own checks? If so, how much do they cost?</li>
                    <li>What are the ATM, overdraft and other fees associated with the account?</li>
                    <li>Will you earn any interest on the funds in your free checking account?</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>When you open a free checking account at CFS, you'll enjoy a variety of benefits, including:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>No minimum balance</li>
                    <li>Unlimited check writing</li>
                    <li>Free online banking</li>
                    <li>Free online bill-pay</li>
                    <li>Free funds transfers in online banking</li>
                    <li>24-hour telephone banking</li>
                    <li>ATM/debit card (upon credit approval)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    In addition, you have the peace of mind of dealing with an FDIC-insured institution. We're confident
                    you'll be happy with your CFS's checking account, and may even consider it the best free checking
                    account you've ever had.

                <h1>What Is a No-Fee Checking Account?</h1>
                <p>
                    Free or no-fee checking accounts are those that do not impose any maintenance or activity fees.
                    According to Informa Research Services, the number of financial institutions offering free or no-fee
                    checking accounts has increased to nearly 60 percent — up over 30 percent since 2001.

                    But not all no-fee checking accounts are really free. Sometimes you're required to keep a minimum
                    balance, or you may incur fees for transactions with a teller or through an ATM machine.
