                <h1>Our Founder</h1>
                <p>The late Dr. Harry Q. Bovik had the vision to make all banking transactions electronic way back in the
                    1980’s, before the web came into existence. His first business, Long Range Transactions, was acquired
                    by Manufacturer’s Hanover in 1990, and he dedicated the proceeds to making CFS a reality. After many
                    difficult years, Dr. Bovik made eBanking really work. Now CFS is proud to be the premier pure eBank!</p>
